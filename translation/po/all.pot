"The rendering phase is further divisible into three optional stages. Every "

"these stages as determined by the file's content string, front matter and "
"extension. The stages are akin to an assembly\n"
"line, with the *output* from a stage being the *input* for the succeeding "
"stage:\n"
"- **Interpreting Liquid expressions in the file**<br/>\n"
"  This stage evaluates Liquid expressions in the current file. By default, "
"the interpretation is *shallow* --- in that\n"
"  any Liquid expression in resulting output is not further "
"interpreted. Moreover, any Liquid expression in the file's\n"
"  front matter is left untouched.\n"
"- **Unleashing the converters**<br/>\n"
"  This stage invokes the converter mapped to the current file's extension "
"and converts the input string. This is when\n"
"  Markdown gets converted into HTML and Sass / Scss into CSS or CoffeeScript "
"into JavaScript, etc, etc. Since this stage\n"
"  is determined by the file's extension, Markdown or Sass inside a `.html` "
"file will remain untouched.\n"
"- **Populating the layouts**<br/>\n"
"  By this stage, *the source file* is considered rendered and it will not be "
"revisited. However, based on the file's\n"
"  extension and consequently based on the front matter, it is determined "
"whether to take the *output* string from\n"
"  the preceding stage and place into layouts or not. Whereas output from "
"Sass files or CoffeeScript files are *never*\n"
"  placed into a layout, regular text output can go either ways based on "
"whether a layout has been assigned via the front\n"
"  matter.<br/><br/>\n"
"  Placement into layouts work similar to how Russian dolls encase the "
"smaller ones within itself or how an oyster\n"
"  generates a pearl --- the converted output from the preceding stage forms "
"the core and layout(s) are successively\n"
"  *rendered* separately onto the core.\n"
